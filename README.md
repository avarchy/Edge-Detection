# Edge-Detection
----------------
Demonstration of Edge Detection using Sobel and Canny algorithms
To run the either edge detection method, you will first need to convert your image to a .ppm file. This can easily be done using ImageMagick.
Simply run the command:
  convert imagefilename image.ppm
## Sobel
For the Sobel edge detection, you will need to run ppm_ConvertTo_pgm.py, SobelSmooth.py, and SobelEdgeDetection.py in that order, substituting the corresponding image file names in the python files.
## Canny
For Canny edge detection, simply run CannyEdgeDetection.py and provide your image's file name in the file.
